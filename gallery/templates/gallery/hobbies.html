        <h3>1977 Classic Mini 1100 Special</h3>
        <p>
        Our love for the UK goes beyond whisky and rolling hills — it extends to Sir Alec Issigonis’
        ingenious design of the Mini. What started as a clever solution to post‑war fuel shortages
        became one of the most iconic small cars ever built. We’re fortunate to own a
        1977 Classic Mini 1100 Special, a special Belgium edition.
        </p>

        <p>
        When we first got the car, it had been neglected for years. Maintenance was patchy, it was colored
        fifty shades of black/purple (even some parts with glitter), and the electrics were unreliable.
        Since then, we’ve been steadily bringing it back to
        life: repainting panels, fixing rust within our possibilities, fixing wiring gremlins,
        replacing windows, and tackling countless
        small jobs. Some repairs we handle ourselves — like the above and normal maintenance —
        while bigger projects are entrusted to a local garage. It’s a balance of DIY
        passion and professional support, each step making the car a little better than before.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Mini has a personality that makes it impossible not
        to smile, every time we open the garage door. Driving it is pure joy: the direct steering,
        the mechanical feedback,
        the sense of connection to the road.

        <h3>2004 Ducati ST3</h3>
        <p>
        The Ducati ST3 is a sport‑tourer that blends Italian character with practical long‑distance
        ability. It has the unmistakable exotic quirks that Ducati is known for: a desmodromic
        engine, revving up to 11,000 RPM, sharp handling, a very satisfying exhaute note...
        And it doesn't like low revs, or speeds below 30 km/h. That's 'character' for you.
        </p>

        <p>
        Much of the maintenance I handle myself: valve clearance checks, timing belts, fluid changes,
        brake pads, and chain care. These jobs demand patience and a steep learning curve,
        but they make the bike
        feel more personal and rewarding. For safety checks and maintenance beyond my skills,
        I rely on a trusted garage.
        </p>

        <p>
        Every ride reminds me why I keep investing time in it. The sound of the engine, the way it
        pulls through corners, and the confidence it inspires on longer trips all make the effort
        worthwhile. It's only been in my pessession since the end of 2024, so I'm looking forward to
        many more miles of adventures ahead.
